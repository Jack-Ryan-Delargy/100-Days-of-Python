The first five days of coursework were completed offline and committed together on Day 5. Moving forward, only completed final projects will be added to keep this repository clean, and organized.

📘 About the Course

This is a comprehensive, project-based Python program focused on building real-world development skills.
The course covers Python from beginner to professional level through hands-on projects in areas such as:

Python fundamentals & scripting

Web development (Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)

Data science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Automation & web scraping (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests)

Machine learning basics (Scikit-Learn)

SQL & databases

GUI development with Tkinter

Version control with Git & GitHub

By the end of the course, I will have completed 100 Python projects, strengthening my portfolio and demonstrating a wide range of technical skills.

🗂 Projects in This Repository

Only selected, polished, and portfolio-ready projects will be committed here.
Examples of the types of projects included:

Small games (Snake, Pong, Blackjack)

Web automation tools

Data analysis and visualization projects

Flask applications

API-based tools

GUI and desktop applications

🎯 Goal

This repository is designed to clearly showcase my Python programming abilities and the real-world projects I've built throughout the course. It highlights clean code, practical applications, and consistent learning progress.

I have decided to also add a table for easy access to see what was accomplished each day:
