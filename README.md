The first five days of coursework were completed offline and committed together on Day 5. Moving forward, only completed final projects will be added to keep this repository clean, and organized.

📘 About the Course

This is a comprehensive, project-based Python program focused on building real-world development skills.
The course covers Python from beginner to professional level through hands-on projects in areas such as:

Python fundamentals & scripting

Automation & web scraping (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests)

Machine learning basics (Scikit-Learn)

SQL & databases

GUI development with Tkinter

Version control with Git & GitHub

By the end of the course, I will have completed 100 Python projects, strengthening my portfolio and demonstrating a wide range of technical skills.
